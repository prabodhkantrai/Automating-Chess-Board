# Automating-Chess-Board

The digital design of an automated chess board with user defined choice of piece and movement variables. Based in Logisim, the chessboard (8x8) utilises a 2 dimensional graph for identifying the piece's location. JK flip-flops are used as input devices along with a reset option to initialise the pieces.

Hardware implementation using an Arduino and Servo motors would ensure no loss of position of the respective pieces.

# Automating-Chess-Board

An automated chess board with user defined choice of piece and movement variables. Based in Logisim, the chessboard (8x8) utilises a 2 dimensional graph for identifying the piece's location. JK flip-flops are used as input devices along with a reset option to initialise the pieces.
